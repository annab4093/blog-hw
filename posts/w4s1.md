W4s1
 some discussion on how you explicitly applied skills learned in the video tutorials, and how you applied elements of design thinking to the task.

Ive learnt that clicking alt duplicates the shape

when drawing a curve p + alt
 line 1 original shape
line 2 not yet drawn shpe
line 2 up ,upward curve 
line 2 down below point ,curve below


prompt or prompts from the Assignment 2 brief appeal to you the most:

Keywords associated with the word "community" include:

Unity
Support
Togetherness
Connection
Collaboration
Fellowship
Belonging
Participation
Cooperation
