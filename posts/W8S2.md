## 4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and to iterate through your project. 
I decided to add an extra classroom and replace walkways with stairs to represent my experience of being a mostly indoors person and my journey concentrated on studying in asian style classrooms in the early years of my life.The straight stairs which requires climbing is perceived as more difficult to walk through than a flat path so it also represent a sense of challenge and struggle living such an lifestyle being restricted to narrow spaces and a straight pathway.

From looking at the entire scene, I realised the skyscraper building (the only one I can download and is free)has a saturated blue and doesn't match the surrounding colour. So I changed it to building that I built using cubes and giving it material to create a similar effect of tall buildings surrounding the pathway and limiting the player's view to the narrow straight path ahead.

I Added walls to classroom and removing unecessary assets like the globe model or the clock that has round lines that have dont have directional straught lines and also directs the players attention away, I controlled the assets in this environment to only containing mostly square or rectangular shapes straight lines that gives a directional guidance forward or left and right but ultimately forward.This creates a sense of how rigid and limiting this indoor environment.

I then added books to further directional guidance.

I added bookshelve on the left side which consists of perspective lines formed by rows on the shelve directing attention towards the door on the left side.This is placed to match the wall on the right side which also has a directional perspective line pointing forward to the vanish point. The desks also so serve to create this almost symmetrical composition creating the sense that this indoor environment is mechanically or rigidly balanced and stagnant space. This forms juxtaposition against curvy paths outdoors allowing a greater sense of freedom of movement.

Stairs:

In order to make stairs walkable, I added cube with a box collider and adjusted its'position and scale to cover its edges and turned off mesh renderer for it to dissapear.




## Implement these sound assets into your project, doing so in layers: i.e: background, looping ambience first, then localised, 3D sounds to aid in navigation and storytelling.
## Sound design
 I added audio source of sound of alarm clock was attached to the clock and when player appears in the bed they hear it to signify that it is time to get out of bed and explore the environment.
 I added audio source of footstep sounds to the floor sound and the heavy footstep sound to also imply struggle walking upstairs.
 I added audio source distant sound of bird and wind to the mountain and trees to remind readers they are outdoors in nature.
