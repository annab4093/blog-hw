## Implement these sound assets into your project, doing so in layers: i.e: background, looping ambience first, then localised, 3D sounds to aid in navigation and storytelling.
## Sound design
 I added audio source of sound of alarm clock was attached to the clock and when player appears in the bed they hear it to signify that it is time to get out of bed and explore the environment.
 I added audio source of footstep sounds to the floor sound and the heavy footstep sound to also imply struggle walking upstairs.
 I added audio source distant sound of bird and wind to the mountain and trees to remind readers they are outdoors in nature.

## 4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and to iterate through your project. 
I decided to add an extra classroom and replace walkways with stairs to represent my experience of being a mostly indoors person and my journey concentrated on studying in asian style classrooms in the early years of my life.The straight stairs which requires climbing is perceived as more difficult to walk through than a flat path so it also represent a sense of challenge and struggle living such an lifestyle being restricted to narrow spaces and a straight pathway.
