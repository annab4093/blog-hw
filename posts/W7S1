3. Take the sketches, notes, and other material generated through this process, and develop them into a series of blog posts that includes:

A short statement of at least 50 words that outlines your core concept in simple terms.
A list of assets (3D models, sounds, textures, etc.) that will be required for your project. Specify which you will create yourself, and which you will source or edit from elsewhere.
A written and/or visual breakdown of how your environment will change or evolve over the journey, and how this connects to your concept. This can include visual references such as your colour palette(s), inspiration, and so on.
A simple map of your environment, produced either traditionally or digitally, that shows how the user will move through the space from beginning to end.
