Thumbnail Sketches Practice
1. Identify a logo or icon that you think is particularly effective at communicating a certain idea. 
![ ](w4s2/airbnb.jpg)
It represents a sense of harmony, community, and togetherness. It consists of a simple, stylized "A" that also resembles a heart. This icon represents the idea of people coming together, forming connections


2. Using traditional or digital drawing tools, produce 

20 alternative thumbnail sketches for this icon/logo.

which of your alternatives is the most effective, and why:

I think the third one on the first row is most effective as it conveys two people reaching an agreement in a house which reflects a sense of harmoney, the hands held together forming a heart shape also convey sense of connection and friendliness. This coupled with a shape resembling a house effectively conveys the app's function of connecting people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodation, and the house symbol is associated with a safe shelter and intends to evoke a sense of belonging.

2. Build from this to produce a series of thumbnail sketches to develop your graphic icons for Assignment 2. You should work quickly and roughly to create at least

 five thumbnail sketches per icon, for a total of least 45 icon concepts.

3. evaluate your work with a post that identifies and comments on the thumbnail sketches that you think are the best for each icon. 
how you applied the elements of design in each case.

The purple highlighted ones are ones I think are the best for each icon.
1 I employed a hexagon shape with another smaller hexagon inside.
2I employed succinct lines to illustrate a pentagon and three lines to form a square door.
3 I employed curved lines to draw the figure and its circle bakcground
4I I employed curved lines to illustrate the oval shape plus I triangular shape combined to form a conversation bubble.
5I used circular shape to present human-like figures forming a larger pentagon together .
6I used a simple circle shape and a curved line enveloping the circle to draw a planet shape
7I used a used black and white contrast to draw a bookmark with flat shadow of same shape.
8I used lines to convey different shape and forms.
9I used a rectangular shapes and thin lines to convey the object.
