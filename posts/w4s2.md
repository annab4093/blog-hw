Thumbnail Sketches Practice
1. Identify a logo or icon that you think is particularly effective at communicating a certain idea.

2. Using traditional or digital drawing tools, produce 20 alternative thumbnail sketches for this icon/logo. 

1. Post the results of the thumbnail sketching activity to your blog, and comment on which of your alternatives is the most effective, and why.

2. Build from this to produce a series of thumbnail sketches to develop your graphic icons for Assignment 2. You should work quickly and roughly to create at least five thumbnail sketches per icon, for a total of least 45 icon concepts. 

3. Upload these sketches to your blog, and evaluate your work with a post that identifies and comments on the thumbnail sketches that you think are the best for each icon. Justify these choices by commenting on how you applied the elements of design in each case.
