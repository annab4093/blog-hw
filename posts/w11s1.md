## wireframes for your planned webpage. 
 I used Figma for wireframing. 

**Process of creating the first wireframe:** 
1. I created new frame with Desktop size: 1440 x 1024 and then changed the height to 4096 so I can have one introduction page and three pages for each project.

2. lay out with rectangles to represent each page on the frame, they are coloured for differentiation.

Making the shapes outside the frame a component(its name turns purple)to prepare for interaction.

3. adding prototype interaction, on click open overlay instantly to manually located place. Then, I tested if they work.

4. I created a set of fixed-on-screen shapes to serve as menu bar, with four shapes to add an interaction. When on click, each of them will allow scrolling towards one of the four pages.
**Intented method of navigation:** using menu to help instantly flip to a certain page without scrolling.

- Realising the interation only work if it is pointed to a shape rather than the frame itself, I had to create a white rectangle and bring it to the back of other grey shapes.

5. I tested if the fixed shapes show while scrolling.

**Process of creating the second wireframe:** 

1. I created new frame with Desktop size: 1440 x 1024 and then changed the height to 5050. This time I changed the height of the frame to add effects that guides scrolling downwards to view content in chronological order without jumping to different pages.

2. The above long rectangles are put together in various lengths from shorter ones on the side to longer ones in the middle to form a directional pointer. The gradient of colour serve to help transition from a dark to light background, whilst intending to encourage audience to scroll down and see what happens next.

3. I added gradient coloured shapes and brought it to the back to serve as background
4.  I added the large rectangles representing image on left and words on the right.

## Arriving at the final wireframe design:
 I prefer the second one as it presents info in chronological sequence by scrolling instead of using menu to jump to different pages.
