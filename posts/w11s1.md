## wireframes for your planned webpage. 
 I used Figma for wireframing. 
 
1. I created new frame with Desktop size: 1440 x 1024 and then changed the height to 4096 so I can have one introduction page and three pages for each project.

2. lay out with rectangles to represent each page on the frame, they are coloured for differentiation.

Making the shapes outside the frame a component(its name turns purple)to prepare for interaction.

3. adding prototype interaction, on click open overlay instantly to manually located place. Then, I tested if they work.

I created a set of fixed-on-screen shapes to serve as menu bar, with four shapes to add an interaction. When on click, each of them will allow scrolling towards one of the four pages.
Realising the interation only work if it is pointed to a shape rather than the frame itself, I had to create a white rectangle and bring it to the back of other grey shapes.

I tested if the fixed shapes show while scrolling.

2. Post these iterations to your blog, and sort through them to arrive at your final wireframe design.

3. Discuss how you arrived at this decision through iteration and experimentation. 
 
wire frame:
block out shape instead of text
texts are also a part of the visual . dont have huge chunk of text
