 ## **Reflection questions on Assignment 1:**
Sonic and Visual Relationship:
I synced visuals with sound to match moods, using fast music and clock ticks for anxiety, and slow, calming music for serenity.

Footage Selection:
I chose footage based on whether they form visual continuity such as round or rectangular shape, or objects to show my aspiration and hobbies such as of bookshelves and instruments to show my interests in reading, filming a book of artist biography to convey my goal to be a great artist.

Sound's Emotional Impact:
I learned music sound can help express feelings, I used it to shift the video's tone from anxious to peaceful.

Pacing and Rhythm in Editing:
I used brisk pacing music and quick cuts to express sense of urgency, slowing down later to reflect personal growth and a calming mindset.

Personality Depiction:
I depicted my personality and interests through the objects I film, aiming to show who I am and what I care about.

Aesthetic Choices:
I made aesthetic choices like camera movement and color grading to express my ideas and connect with the audience.

Key Moment Identification:
The transition from a clock scene to a 'to do' list zooming in marks a shift from anxiety to action.

Sound Design Strategy:
I plan to use a ticking clock and urgent music for this moment, creating pressure with visuals of tasks mounting.

Emotional Tone and Editing:
The video's tone moves from anxious to calm, with editing choices supporting this transition through music and scene length.

Audience Understanding:
The audience should see the connection between the late-night lamp and clock, sound of clock ticking and the burst of anxiety it represents.

Rhythm, Tempo, and Pace:
Starting with fast-paced scenes and music, I'll transition to slower scenes and music to reflect an inner shift towards calmness.

## **Reflection questions on Assignment 2:**
Idea Behind the Suite of Icons:
The suite of icons was designed for an anonymous community app, focusing on warmth and relaxation to foster a comforting user experience. The theme was chosen to align with the app's purpose of providing emotional support without the need for personal identification.

Iteration Process:
Multiple approaches were explored. Iterations involved refining the concept and functionality of each icon. Changes across iterations included adjustments to shape, size, and color to enhance clarity and emotional impact. The final design was selected for its effectiveness in conveying the intended message and functionality.

Translation from Sketches to Final Designs:
Thumbnail sketches were translated into flat designs in Illustrator by refining outlines, adjusting sizes, and applying colors and gradients. Nothing significant was lost in translation; instead, the digital process allowed for more precise control, enhancing the overall design quality.

Use of Color:
Color was used to create unity across the icons with a warm palette that promotes a calming effect. The chosen palette was selected to visually represent the app's soothing and inclusive environment, ensuring that the icons are both aesthetically pleasing and functionally clear.

Correspondence of Sound and Visual Elements:
Sound elements in the audio design corresponded to the visual elements to reinforce the emotional response. For example, a mechanical sound for the settings icon complements its gear-like appearance, while a bubbly pop sound for the chat icon mirrors its friendly and inviting visual design.

Translating the Abstract Idea to Visual Designs:
The abstract idea of an anonymous support community was translated into concrete visual designs by focusing on universal symbols and metaphors. Each icon was crafted to represent its function within the app, using shapes, color, and sound that evoke the intended emotional response and guide user interaction.

## **Reflection questions on Assignment 3:**
1. Working Prototype Importance:
The prototype was key for layout, testing its scale and design player interactions and narrative flow.

2. 3D vs. 2D Design Experience:
3D design added complexity and immersion, requiring consideration of spatial relationships and player movement, beyond the scope of 2D design.

3. Role of Virtual Camera:
The camera guided first person player perspective in 3D, similar to 2D but with added complexity and player freedom.

4. Use of Sound:
Sound set the mood, environment matching sound adds realism to the experience.

5. Unifying Theme/Concept:
The environment's design choices unified under the theme of and personal change of lifestyle, evolving from restrictive to open and vibrant.

6. Play Testing Discoveries:
Play testing revealed player behaviors and interactions, guiding refinements for a more engaging and effective narrative experience.
