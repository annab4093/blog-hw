## iterate on your greybox prototype by establishing your approach to proportion, form/void relationships, and other elements of spatial composition.

I surround straight paths with fence shaped cubes to serve as guidance, these may later be changed to actual fences or plants.
The pathway surrounded by fence and high rise buildings conveys a sense of its narrowness and creates a little repressive vibe compared to later open outdoor space after the huge gate.

the door of bedroom and  classroom and gate will signify transition.
I added a huge gate, itS largesize relative to previous interior doors and the player to signify prominent transition of environment. 

then switch to curly environmemt outdoors in the mountains with curvy path allowing discovery in the process.

## 3. Once the entire environment is roughly blocked out in this fashion, you may steadily replace your primitives with the final assets over the remainder of the project. Ensure that you add appropriate mesh colliders to these assets, as per the above video tutorial.

## Replacing the cubes with asset:

## Process: 

Upon trying to find free downloadable assets for bedroom, I discovered that all the completed bedrooms are not free 
So I downloaded and individual bed to build upon a corner of a room with only two walls and a computer desks and added assets of bookshelves a study desk that has Chinese subjects names written on the text books to reflect my childhood experiences of concentrating on studying indoor. I used cubes to build the two walls, ceiling and applied dark textured material to it. I used a script to make the door automatically opening after a while, guiding player to walk pass the door.I put a cube with box collider underneath the stair to allow walking

Both bedroom and classroom scene were built by combining imcomplete corners of the rooms downloaded and adding walls to make it a closed environment. In building the bedroom, I removed and added individual assets to create the indoor room I want, deleted too saturated or colourful items or other items to like posters, computer or ipad that enriches one's life to align with my intention of depicting an indoor life concentrated of study. I adjusted its proportion enlarged its width but did not enlarge its height to make the room appear more narrow because of the low ceiling simultaneouly empty without much items to depict an unenjoyable indoor life. The palete is desaturated and thus depressive.

I added doors to indoor rooms and added a door opening script to the door setting it to rotate automatically and tested they worked and opens automatically in play mode.
