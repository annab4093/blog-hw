2. Based on the playtesting session from today's class, and the principles discussed in the lecture, iterate on your greybox prototype by establishing your approach to proportion, form/void relationships, and other elements of spatial composition.

I surround straight paths with fence shaped cubes to serve as guidance, these may later be changed to actual fences or plants.
The pathway surrounded by fence and high rise buildings conveys a sense of its narrowness and creates a little repressive vibe compared to later open outdoor space after the huge gate.

the door of bedroom and  classroom and gate will signify transition

I added a huge gate, itS largesize relative to previous interior doors and the player to signify prominent transition of environment. 

then switch to curly environmemt outdoors with curvy path allowing discovery in the process.

3. Once the entire environment is roughly blocked out in this fashion, you may steadily replace your primitives with the final assets over the remainder of the project. Ensure that you add appropriate mesh colliders to these assets, as per the above video tutorial.

4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and iterate on your design document with any changes that you need to make to either your concept or project. Document and justify these changes as you go.

I decided to add an extra classroom and replace walkways with stairs to represent my experience of being a mostly indoors person and my journey concentrated on studying in asian style classrooms in the early years of my life.The straight stairs which requires climbing is perceived as more difficult to walk through than a flat path so it also represent a sense of challenge and struggle living such an lifestyle being restricted to narrow spaces and a straight pathway.
