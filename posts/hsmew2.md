# Week two journal: Emotional models

## Classical 2-D Valence–Arousal: Russell’s Circumplex (1980)

– Axes: Valence (pleasant ↔ unpleasant) & Arousal (activated ↔ deactivated).
– Limitations: static snapshots, no temporal depth.
– Where is the sublime? → High-arousal, mixed-valence quadrant (astonishment, awe).

Temporal Extension
The Two Fundamental Dimensions
**Valence**(Pleasure-Displeasure Continuum)

This dimension ranges from **highly positive, pleasant feelings (like joy or happiness) to highly negative, unpleasant feelings (like sadness or anger)** .

It represents the subjective evaluation of whether an experience is good or bad, desirable or undesirable 14.

**Arousal** (Activation-Deactivation Continuum)

This dimension ranges from **high activation states (like excitement or alertness)** to **low activation states (like calmness or sleepiness)**

It reflects the physiological and psychological intensity of the affective experience

## Latinjak’s 3-D Model (2012)

– Adds Time Orientation: **Past, Present, Future**
– Reveals how anticipation (future) or nostalgia (past) modulates arousal/valence.

## Cognitive Appraisal

Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) Model
– Three branches:
Consequences of events → Well-being emotions (joy, distress).
Actions of agents → Attribution emotions (pride, shame).
Aspects of objects → Attraction emotions (like, dislike).
– Emotion intensity tied to goal relevance & standards.

Aesthetic Profound Experience

## Affect Space Theory (Emery, North & Hargreaves 2016)

This theory offers a multidimensional approach to analyzing how we experience art, music, and other aesthetic objects by distinguishing between different components of aesthetic response.

Core Components of the Affect Space Framework
The Affect Space Framework consists of three key dichotomous classifications that together create a comprehensive model for analyzing aesthetic experience:

1. Locus of Experience: Internal vs. External
   Internal locus refers to the subjective, **felt experience** of the individual engaging with the aesthetic object

External locus involves the **description and properties** of the aesthetic object itself

This distinction separates the phenomenological experience from the objective qualities that evoke it

2. Valence Types: Affect-Valence vs. Emotion-Valence
   Affect-valence represents the **attraction to (positive) or repulsion from (negative)** the artwork/object (e.g., preference, awe, hatred, disgust)

Emotion-valence concerns the character/contemplation of **discrete emotions** (e.g., happiness, sadness)

This separation allows for the **possibility of being attracted to artworks that express negative emotions**

3. Hedonic Tone: Deep vs. Shallow
   **Deep hedonic** tone involves profound aesthetic experiences like **awe, being moved, and spiritual encounters**

\***\*Shallow hedonic** tone includes more **superficial responses like preference, pleasure, and enjoyment**

The framework proposes deep hedonic tone as a better indicator of true aesthetic experience

– Deep vs Shallow Hedonic Tone
Deep: awe, chills, transcendence → sublime
Shallow: mere pleasantness, boredom
– Bridges emotion theory to multisensory design impact.
