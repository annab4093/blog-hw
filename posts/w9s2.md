I put a box collider underneath the outdoor scene to allow walking and left oven a curly paths by using the mountains and tress. This allows players to look around the space and enjoy the open scenery, contrary to previous straight path used to only lead player to view and go ahead in one direction




Upon trying to find free downloadable assets for bedroom, I discovered that all the completed bedrooms are not free 
So I downloaded and individual bed to build upon a corner of a room with only two walls and a computer desks and added assets of bookshelves a study desk that has Chinese subjects names written on the text books to reflect my childhood experiences of concentrating on studying indoor.

The colour palette was relatively low saturated and not very colourful at the beginning of the journey. I built the room putting together low saturation assets and the height of the room was deliberately lowered relative to its width and a proportion of the ceiling can be easily seen from the first person perspective. These designs intend to create a little claustrophobic and repressive mood.

The alarm clock and its sound serve to inform player that they should do something and get out of the bed location to walk around and as the door slowly opens, guiding player to go out.





My initial idea was to use a fence to lead the way forward. However, I ended up employing the staircases to serve as a metaphor that being a young student in China life is like climbing up a one-way ladder with one only one goal which is to get higher academic ranking. Being a student in China, the only pathway available was to past the entrance exam for junior school and then you have to prepare for your high school entrance exam and then prepare for university entrance exam. So I only design one pathway leading towards the classrooms and the other way out until it reaches point to major change.


the negative shape of the stair is one that both left and right side are blocked by white buildings limitimg the pathway to walking staight on the stairs and and limit the view to focus on what is infront.The brightness of the classroom ceiling also serve to capture player's attention encouraging them to head towards that.

The desks in the first classroom scene also form straight pathways allowing players to walk around between spaces  but ultimately guiding the player forward.

 The employment of low saturation colour continued until the second classroom where the major change is about to occur.
I put a few colourful books next to of the door to serve as guidance leading the player to direct their focus towards the way out.

Outside the door I the major point of change occurs environment of lively saturated mountains and plants. This point of change symbolise how I moved to Australia and saw that life wasnâ€™t just about a single straight pathway to get higher academic results, rather life is about taking time to appreciate the world, appreciate nature and relaxing outdoors. This is also why I used a curvy pathway allowing players to wander around to enjoy the scenery.
Here I added sound of wind and birds tweeting.
