## Brainstorm and develop some ideas for your digital environment for Assignment 3.

change of lifestyle seen through change in space in and outdoors.
The lifestyle can be due to change of mindset and showcased through change of environment as I grew up and migrated from one country to another.

## A short statement of at least 50 words that outlines your core concept in simple terms.

How my lifestyle changed from spending time mostly indoors concentrated on studying to taking time to explore the world outside outdoors and appreciating nature.So I would like to depict a route starting from an indoors space to exploring outdoor environment.

When I was younger, like many asian kids, living in China, I conformed to pursueing the same goal which is to study laboriously in to achieve good grades, middles school entrance exam to enter a good middle school, and pass the university entrance exam, living in a space with lots of pressure to climb to a higher ranking school, and thus has minimal time to go outside indoorspaces. After I moved out of China, I began appreciating that one's life doesn't have to be solely focused on persuing academic results so I started spending more time outside indoor spaces and began to enjoy seeing natural sceneries. This change in my lifestyle is what a would like to depict.

## A written and/or visual breakdown of how your environment will change or evolve over the journey, and how this connects to your concept. This can include visual references such as your colour palette(s), inspiration, and so on.

1 I would begin with an environment of a low saturation and relatively dark coloured bedroom with bookshelve and homework and textbooks on desk representing my life concentrated on studies when I lived in China.

2 walking out the door,There will be a straight Pathway with landmarks fence guilding player to walk past, and no other routes outside the door to symbolise how young Asian children are not presented with the another lifestyle other than be indoors and study rigoroously. The pathway is surrounded by high rise building blocks blocking view and disable seeing anything in the distant.

3 Next will be the classroom setting, I chose to display these two spaces and connect them as most of my childhood time are spent in classroom learning and in my bedroom doing homework.
With the desks are labelled in aligned olumns and rows with a sense of structure and organisation vibe but lacking saturated colour.
There is a board

4 a Gate signalling major change- leading pathway to the gate- signify transformation from spending most of time indoor to colourful world outdoors

5 curvy pathways to guide player through and seeing scene of nature colourful mountain and plants
to create a sense of openess, the pathway will be larger than the straight path.

## A simple map of your environment, produced either traditionally or digitally, that shows how the user will move through the space from beginning to end.
