## Ask a friend, family member, classmate or someone else to playtest your work. Give them a set amount of time to explore your environment, and don't give them any instructions about where to go or what to do.  
 Using a screen recording method of your choice, create a screen recording of their testing of your work. Use this recording to improve your design by looking for elements that may be confusing, overlooked, or otherwise in need of adjustment.
 Post this recording to your blog, and write a post detailing the testing session, including who your tester was, what the results of the session were, and how the results will inform the design of your project moving forward.

My bother and a friend played this.
 ## The feedbacks and my response are:
  One that the change the colour of the pathways outdoor environment look too grey,so I changed it to be green and added more plants. The second  feeedback is the cubes of the building could be closer put together and I changed the colour of the cubes and the position to form a narrow and colour serve to enhance a directional path.The third feedback is  to adjust the height of the desk so I adjusted the proportion lowering the height of the desk.
