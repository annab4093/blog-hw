1. Ask a friend, family member, classmate or someone else to playtest your work. Give them a set amount of time to explore your environment, and don't give them any instructions about where to go or what to do.  

2. Using a screen recording method of your choice, create a screen recording of their testing of your work. Use this recording to improve your design by looking for elements that may be confusing, overlooked, or otherwise in need of adjustment.




3. Post this recording to your blog, and write a post detailing the testing session, including who your tester was, what the results of the session were, and how the results will inform the design of your project moving forward.
