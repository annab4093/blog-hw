# Week one journal

I had a look at the physiological signs that constitutes different emotional states. Thus I can define my desired emotional outcome- sublime and use audiovisual information to elicit such emotion within audience.

A three-dimensional cube maps the three major monoamine systems (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline) onto Tomkins’ eight basic emotions.
| Axis | Neurotransmitter | Brain Origin | Psychological Theme |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **x-axis** | **Serotonin (5-HT)** | Raphe nuclei | Inner strength, self-confidence, satiety |
| **y-axis** | **Noradrenaline (NE)** | Locus coeruleus | Arousal, vigilance, activation |
| **z-axis** | **Dopamine (DA)** | VTA / Substantia nigra | Reward, motivation, reinforcement |

| Emotion (Tomkins label)   | 5-HT | NE  | DA  | Brief Justification                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---- | --- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shame / Humiliation**   | 0    | 0   | 0   | “Defeated, naked” – global monoamine deficit         |
| **Distress / Anguish**    | 0    | 1   | 0   | Crying, active arousal but no reward or confidence   |
| **Fear / Terror**         | 0    | 0   | 1   | “White-cold” fear; low arousal, high learning signal |
| **Anger / Rage**          | 0    | 1   | 1   | “Fight” reaction; high arousal + high motivation     |
| **Contempt / Disgust**    | 1    | 0   | 0   | Superiority + satiety, rejection without arousal     |
| **Enjoyment / Joy**       | 1    | 0   | 1   | Contentment; reward without high arousal             |
| **Surprise / Startle**    | 1    | 1   | 0   | Orienting reflex; confidence + arousal, no reward    |
| **Interest / Excitement** | 1    | 1   | 1   | Peak engagement; all systems “on”                    |

Therefore,via designing audiovisual stimulis in the environment, these neurotransmitters can be activated to create the desired emotional outcome. The next thing to do is to define and elaborate on which of the basic emotional states constitutes the state of sublime.

**Reflection**
I chose the sublime because it is the one affect that digital media can amplify beyond physical possibility—through visual data and sound. As a designer, I am drawn to experiences that momentarily delete the user’s ego, resetting their relationship to environment and thought provoking. My future work may explore by immersing viewers in a similar experience, evoking sublime and thus compassionate that motivates action rather than mere awe.

Academic areas to investigate..
art and design,
• film/sound/music studies,
• multi-sensory design,
• affective design
• experience design
• sensory system research
• architecture
• aromaachology
• communication design
• bioacoustics
• music therapy
• medical literature
• evolutionary biology
• consciousness studies
• cultural studies
• the science of awe
• For each project you must justify your design
choices for your HMsEx (or experiences)
• You can choose more than one state, but you
must justify each work.
• Must be reflected in your blog, and project
presentations

Academic references, technical manuals, industry specific
podcasts, relevant YouTube tutorials
• visual works of art and designs, films, installations, books, pieces
of music, games, performances, VR, light and sound, tactile or
vibroacoustic experiences
• Be descriptive, explain how your research is helping to enhance
or influence your design or your ideas
• Don’t quote references or provide examples of other’s work
without analysis
• Go beyond dictionary definitions and easy summaries (this is just
a starting point)
References

Impressive works
• Bold works
• Heightened works (affective works)
• Multi-sensory works
