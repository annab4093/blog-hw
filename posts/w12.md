## Feedback that I received: 
The effect of rectangles look cool.

I am glad to find out that this effect made by layer blur did have an intended effect to lead audience to scroll down.

## Making the Phone webpage:
I **transfered the content** to Phone frame size by first selecting all the layers inside the frame, select 'Constraint' 'scale' then change frame so that the content are still crammed inside the frame when I moved them into a smaller frame, and then adjusted the individual text smaller and shape sizes to fit in. 

I redesigned the **location of overlay to appear** on left or tight side so there space left to click out.

I also redesigned the intro page and added an **arrow** to balance and forms a triangular composition which gives a sense of visual stability compare to an almost diagonal composition without this tiny addition. The arrow and its rectangle shape behind has low brightnews and low opacity so as not to capture too much attention.

In contrast, the **rectangle at centre** has a higher saturation compared to the texts,  is is also placed at the centre encouraging audience to click.

## Design decisions:
coherence in style and colour

- I used **same font choices**, "Jomolhari" for headings "JetBrains Mono" for body through out the webpage to create **stylistic coherence**. Just like the introduction page, all the Texts in the 3 main body pages varied in size with the headings I want audience to notice first being the largest and the captions being the smallest.

- In all three main body pages, the colours of shapes are **matching colours** on images of projects to create a sense of unison.
Eg I chose blue and brown for the shapes as they align with actual colour from the image.
On the **below image**, see the blueish grey on bedsheet, brown, and white.

- I didnâ€™t like how the black on the image breaks the **coherence of colour**, so I added Inner Shadow effect to reduce the black.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I maintainted the **style** of blurred shapes with clear words on top so as to avoid the hard edges of shapes competing for audience's attention, allowing for better focus on words whilst creating aesthetically pleasant webpage.
For the same reason, I set **radius corner** of the image shapes to 13 to prevent a pointy vertex yet without making the rectangle too round. 

Other than aesthetic reason, this **combination of blurred shapes and clear edges of lines** shown in the texts and shape also **reflects my personality**: Blurred shapes suggest a more abstract and open-minded approach to things, while clear-edged lines communicates information clearly indicate a preference for structure and organization. It's like the balance between creativity and a liking for precision and effeciency in my personality.
