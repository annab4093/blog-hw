HSME

Sublime is a emotional state which lifts the mind from the ordinary to the transcendent. characterized by a mix of awe, terror, and transcendence, typically triggered by encounters with vast, grandiose, powerful, incomprehensible or overwhelming phenomena (e.g., nature, art, or scale).

Sublime could involves a tension between fear and fascination.

Tactics for Generating the Sublime (literature summary)
• Scale manipulation – extreme size differentials (micro/macro).

• Temporal dilation – exposure to deep time, slow change, decay.
• Edge conditions – liminal spaces, precarious vantage points.
• Sensorial overload – immersive sound, overwhelming luminosity.
• Cognitive dissonance – beauty married to danger or absurdity.
• Technological augmentation – VR, 8K video, spatial audio to extend perception past the body’s limits.
