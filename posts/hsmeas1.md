# define sublime

Sublime is a emotional state which lifts the mind from the ordinary to the transcendent. characterized by a mix of awe, terror, and transcendence, typically triggered by encounters with vast, grandiose, powerful, incomprehensible or overwhelming phenomena (e.g., nature, art, or scale).

Sublime could involves a tension between fear and fascination.

Tactics for Generating the Sublime l

• Scale manipulation – extreme size differentials (micro/macro).

• Temporal dilation – exposure to deep time, slow change, decay.

• Edge conditions – liminal spaces, precarious vantage points.

• Sensorial overload – immersive sound, overwhelming luminosity.

• Cognitive dissonance – beauty married to danger or absurdity.

• Technological augmentation – VR, 8K video, spatial audio to extend perception past the body’s limits.

# Analysis

## Grand Canyon

![**The Grand Canyon**](hsme/1gc.jpg)

Both gazing up from the foot and from the summit makes human to feel humble in the face of nature's masterpiece. The sheer scale and geological time embedded texture in the Grand Canyon’s stratified cliff. The recurring rings echoes the weight of time and solemnity. The play of light at sunrise—casting deep shadows and glowing reds—enhances the feeling of heaviness as if standing before an ancient, indifferent force. Altogether offering a visceral sense of the sublime.

## Olafur Eliasson, The Weather Project (Tate Modern, 2003)

Eliasson’s artificial sun at the Tate Modern, shrouded in mist and mirrored on the ceiling, immerses viewers in an illusory infinity. The gigantic artificially recreated sun appear as if time becomes static, making the viewer feel a sense of abnormality, epic,and granderous that transcends mundane life. The extended height of the space aids the audience' perception of such feelings merging art and environment.The mirror casting back the audience underneathe as small as insects when seen from afar and below resounds humanitys' fragility in the face of the universe and the infinite. The work used scale to manipulates perception, making the man-made feel cosmic and overwhelming sublime.

## Zaha Hadid’s Heydar Aliyev Center (Architecture)

![Zaha Hadid’s Heydar Aliyev Center (Architecture)](hsme/heydar.jpg)

Hadid’s fluid, gravity-defying curves create an uncanny sense of motion frozen in time. The building’s seamless white surfaces and lack of right angles evoke an almost alien grandeur, making the viewer feel as if they’ve stepped into a futuristic dreamscape.The semigloss texture, large scale use of white juxtaposed against dark grey, and erasure of other vibrant colour is unseen in nature and thus alienating and awe-inspiring. The void openspace in front of the building and the architect's predominant use of white iterates silence and the sort of purity that evokes reverence, it thus has a meditative and sublime effect. Again, height and scale are used to heighten the architecture's vastness.

## James Turrell’s Roden Crater (Land Art)

![James Turrell’s Roden Crater (Land Art)](hsme/RodenCrater.jpg)
Turrell’s transformation of a volcanic crater into a celestial observatory frames the sky as a living canvas.
The controlled apertures and shifting light create moments where the heavens seem to descend, evoking sacred awe. Chambers frame celestial events and colour fields so the sky feels tactile. The visitor loses horizon cues and vertiginously merges with the cosmos.

## The Sagrada Família (Architecture)

![The Sagrada Família (Architecture)](hsme/Sagrada.jpg)
Gaudí’s unfinished cathedral, with its organic spires and kaleidoscopic stained glass, dissolves the boundary between earth and sky. The interior’s dappled light and towering columns mimic a forest.Alongside with its height,it evokes both divine wonder and natural sublimity.

## Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama (Installation Art)

![ Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama (Installation Art)](hsme/infinity.jpg)
Each mirrored chamber is a shoebox cosmos: LED orbs, floating lanterns multiply into countless vanishing points, dissolving walls, floor and ceiling into an endless void. The body is atomised; the viewer sees themself recede into countless reflections until identity becomes a speck inside a boundless lattice. Scale is weaponised: a room the size of a lift car suddenly feels galactic, collapsing human measure into astronomical vastness. The repetition is both hypnotic and faintly threatening—like being swallowed by a digital black hole that keeps spawning copies of you. By shrinking the threshold between self and cosmos to the width of a two-way mirror, Kusama engineers a vertiginous sublime that is intimate yet infinite, fragile yet terrifying.

## The Large Hadron Collider tunnel

![The Large Hadron Collider tunnel(Technological Sublime)](hsme/collider.jpg)
The sheer scale and incomprehensible power of this particle accelerator evoke awe at humanity’s reach into the unknown. Its vastness and its artificially designed representation of mankinds' transcendental scientific power that create the feeling of sublime with a blend of wonder and terror .

## The Northern Lights (Natural Phenomenon)

![The Northern Lights (Natural Phenomenon)](hsme/aurora.webp)
The aurora borealis, with its undulating colors and celestial origins, embodies the sublime in nature. Its unpredictability and otherworldly glow evokes within viewers a sense of humans'insignificance in the face of the cosmos.

## TeamLab Borderless (Tokyo, 2018)

![borderless](hsme/borderless.jpeg)
Rooms of responsive LED waterfalls and mirrored corridors dissolve bodily boundaries into cascades of colour. The self becomes pixel dust, sublime in its dispersal.

## Agnes Denes, Wheatfield – A Confrontation (NYC, 1982)

## Marshmallow Laser Feast, Treehugger (VR, 2020)

![Marshmallow Laser Feast, Treehugger (VR, 2020)](hsme/marshmallow.jpg)
Haptic bark and volumetric scans of a 3,000-year-old sequoia let users shrink to insect size and climb its vascular system. The tree’s interior becomes a cathedral, collapsing millennia into a 7-minute loop. The complexity, magnificent beauty reminds human of our inferiority in the face of nature and unknown, thus making the experience sublime.

**Reflection**
I chose the sublime because it is the one affect that digital media can amplify beyond physical possibility—through visual data and sound. As a designer, I am drawn to experiences that momentarily delete the user’s ego, resetting their relationship to environment and thought provoking. My future work may explore by immersing viewers in a similar experience, evoking sublime and thus compassionate that motivates action rather than mere awe.

## Week one journal

I had a look at the physiological signs that constitutes different emotional states. Thus I can define my desired emotional outcome- sublime and use audiovisual information to elicit such emotion within audience.
A three-dimensional cube maps the three major monoamine systems (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline) onto Tomkins’ eight basic emotions.
| Axis | Neurotransmitter | Brain Origin | Psychological Theme |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **x-axis** | **Serotonin (5-HT)** | Raphe nuclei | Inner strength, self-confidence, satiety |
| **y-axis** | **Noradrenaline (NE)** | Locus coeruleus | Arousal, vigilance, activation |
| **z-axis** | **Dopamine (DA)** | VTA / Substantia nigra | Reward, motivation, reinforcement |

| Emotion (Tomkins label)   | 5-HT | NE  | DA  | Brief Justification                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---- | --- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shame / Humiliation**   | 0    | 0   | 0   | “Defeated, naked” – global monoamine deficit         |
| **Distress / Anguish**    | 0    | 1   | 0   | Crying, active arousal but no reward or confidence   |
| **Fear / Terror**         | 0    | 0   | 1   | “White-cold” fear; low arousal, high learning signal |
| **Anger / Rage**          | 0    | 1   | 1   | “Fight” reaction; high arousal + high motivation     |
| **Contempt / Disgust**    | 1    | 0   | 0   | Superiority + satiety, rejection without arousal     |
| **Enjoyment / Joy**       | 1    | 0   | 1   | Contentment; reward without high arousal             |
| **Surprise / Startle**    | 1    | 1   | 0   | Orienting reflex; confidence + arousal, no reward    |
| **Interest / Excitement** | 1    | 1   | 1   | Peak engagement; all systems “on”                    |

Therefore,via designing audiovisual stimulis in the environment, these neurotransmitters can be activated to create the desired emotional outcome. The next thing to do is to define and elaborate on which of the basic emotional states constitutes the state of sublime.
