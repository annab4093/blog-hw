# define sublime

Sublime is a emotional state which lifts the mind from the ordinary to the transcendent. characterized by a mix of awe, terror, and transcendence, typically triggered by encounters with vast, grandiose, powerful, incomprehensible or overwhelming phenomena (e.g., nature, art, or scale).

Sublime could involves a tension between fear and fascination.

Tactics for Generating the Sublime (literature summary)
• Scale manipulation – extreme size differentials (micro/macro).
• Temporal dilation – exposure to deep time, slow change, decay.
• Edge conditions – liminal spaces, precarious vantage points.
• Sensorial overload – immersive sound, overwhelming luminosity.
• Cognitive dissonance – beauty married to danger or absurdity.
• Technological augmentation – VR, 8K video, spatial audio to extend perception past the body’s limits.

## Grand Canyon

Both gazing up from the foot and from the summit makes human to feel humble in the face of nature's masterpiece. The sheer scale and geological time embedded texture in the Grand Canyon’s stratified cliff. The recurring rings echoes the weight of time and solemnity. The play of light at sunrise—casting deep shadows and glowing reds—enhances the feeling of heaviness as if standing before an ancient, indifferent force. Altogether offering a visceral sense of the sublime.

Eliasson’s artificial sun at the Tate Modern, shrouded in mist and mirrored on the ceiling, immerses viewers in an illusory infinity. The gigantic artificially recreated sun appear as if time becomes static, making the viewer feel a sense of abnormality, epic,and granderous that transcends mundane life. The extended height of the space aids the audience' perception of such feelings merging art and environment.The mirror reflecting the audience underneathe as small as insects when seen from afar and below resounds humanitys' fragility in the face of the universe. The work used scale to manipulates perception, making the man-made feel cosmic and overwhelming sublime.

Hadid’s fluid, gravity-defying curves create an uncanny sense of motion frozen in time. The building’s seamless white surfaces and lack of right angles evoke an almost alien grandeur, making the viewer feel as if they’ve stepped into a futuristic dreamscape

## James Turrell’s Roden Crater (Land Art)

Turrell’s transformation of a volcanic crater into a celestial observatory frames the sky as a living canvas.
The controlled apertures and shifting light create moments where the heavens seem to descend, evoking sacred awe. Chambers frame celestial events and colour fields so the sky feels tactile. The visitor loses horizon cues and vertiginously merges with the cosmos.

## The Sagrada Família (Architecture)

Gaudí’s unfinished cathedral, with its organic spires and kaleidoscopic stained glass, dissolves the boundary between earth and sky. The interior’s dappled light and towering columns mimic a forest, evoking both divine wonder and natural sublimity.

## The Large Hadron Collider tunnel

Rooms of responsive LED waterfalls and mirrored corridors dissolve bodily boundaries into cascades of colour. The self becomes pixel dust, sublime in its dispersal.

## Marshmallow Laser Feast, Treehugger (VR, 2020)

Haptic bark and volumetric scans of a 3,000-year-old sequoia let users shrink to insect size and climb its vascular system. The tree’s interior becomes a cathedral, collapsing millennia into a 7-minute loop. The complexity, magnificent beauty reminds human of our inferiority in the face of nature and unknown, thus making the experience sublime.

**Reflection**
I chose the sublime because it is the one affect that digital media can amplify beyond physical possibility—through visual data and sound. As a designer, I am drawn to experiences that momentarily delete the user’s ego, resetting their relationship to environment and thought provoking. My future work may explore by immersing viewers in a similar experience, evoking sublime and thus compassionate that motivates action rather than mere awe.
