omework Tasks - Week 2, Session 1
1. produce a storyboard or storyboards for your Assignment 1 project.

2. You may use screenshots of any footage you've shot so far, or your own illustrations to indicate the composition and movement of shots and visual elements.

3. Upload your storyboard to your blog, along with a discussion of how you will establish and maintain continuity (and/or discontinuity)!!!! in your work.


I intended to establish continuity via filming  objects that have silimilar round shapes: clock, lid of watercolour paint, eye, bowl of water...
square/rectangular shaped objects: painting, camera .
footage with the same direction of left and right movement.


4. specifically discuss how your approach to editing will contribute to the 
main theme, concept, action, or emotion you hope to offer the viewer.


the main theme I want to present is who am I. So I decided to present my various interests in life, aspiration to become a great artist, and my feelings when coming into the course.
I  would like to show the interest via filming bookshelves, the instruments I play and I may use the camera panning to create some movement connect these scenes.including filming books about an artist's biography to show such aspiration.
At the start of the sequence  i would like to establish a sense of anxiety,which how I feel coming into this course, with how broad thiscourse is, and I feel that time will be running out if I want to master any individuL field and be able to create something freely without the restrictions of limited technical knowledge, while also having time to accomplish the things I want to achieve outside school.
Thus to create this sense of time running out and a feeling of anxiety, I would like to use fast pacing music coupled with the cound of clock ticking at the start to bring the audience to perceive a sense of urgency.
Towards the middle of the sequence I would also like to slow the pacing down a little to achieve a calmer tone, as I am also aspired to become a calmer and less anxious person. This will probablly be done with the change of music to one that is calmer,slower and has a relaxing tone to offer a sense of serenity. I will also incorporate scenes of nature such as trees and birds that offer a sense of peace and relaxation.



 

Homework Tasks - Week 2, Session 2


2. Identify a key moment in your planned two minute sequence for Assignment 1: one that the success of the project is likely to depend upon.

a key moment will be the clock scene to the writing of 'to do' zooming in


3.how you are planning to use sound design and soundtrack to construct this moment. Focus particularly on the relationship between the audio and visual elements.


I would use clock ticking sound and fast pacing music to create a sense of urgency and this will work together with the visual of the words TO Do being zoomed in to create a sense of pressure.
The pacing of music along with visual of quick scenes flashing up also creates this sense of urgency.


4. As part of this discussion, consider the following questions:

  - What is the emotional tone of the broader portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?

Overall the emotional tone will transition from urgency , anxiety to more calmer tone. The quicker pace of music and sound effects (clock ticking and sound of brush strokes)
at the start will bring out an anxious mood and the lack of these sound effects later on will help bring audience away from the initial sense of anxiety. Meanwhile the quick pacing music transitions to slower pacing one to offer sense of serenity.

  - What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? 
The clock showing a three o'clock and night lamp indicates that this is late at night and the eye opening scene indicates that this is me getting a outburst of anxiety at night.


What connection are you trying to forge?
  - What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?
Scenes flashing up will match the tempo of the quick paced music and clock ticking sound to create a fast pacing rythem in this moment.

5.storyboard that accounts for the sonic elements of your project.

Homework Tasks - Week 3, Session 1
1. Based on your storyboard, produce a draft of your video portrait for Assignment 1. It doesn't have to be the finished version, but it should be pretty close.

2. Upload this draft to your YouTube or Vimeo account, post it to your blog, and write a blog post that 
discusses your 

process in producing this draft.

First I uploaded all the footages and named them, then I sort out the sequence timeline with these footages, connecting them based on their catagory ( round objects)(scenes with panning movement left or right ) (nature scenes).
Then I find the music and sound effects to work on the pacing and duration of both visual and audio.

3. Prepare a brief written introduction to your work. It should explain your general concept and intentions with the work in a clear, concise, and professional manner.

Overview of

concept:
the main theme I want to present is who am I. So I decided to present my various interests in life, aspiration to become a great artist, and my feelings when coming into the course.
I  would like to show the interest via filming bookshelves, the instruments I play and I may use the camera panning to create some movement connect these scenes.including filming books about an artist's biography to show such aspiration.
At the start of the sequence  i would like to establish a sense of anxiety,which how I feel coming into this courseã€‚
Thus to create this sense of time running out and a feeling of anxiety, I would like to use fast pacing music coupled with the cound of clock ticking at the start to bring the audience to perceive a sense of urgency.

Technology:
I Etablished continuity via filming  objects that have silimilar round shapes: clock, lid of watercolour paint, eye, bowl of water...
square/rectangular shaped objects: painting, camera .
footage with the same direction of left and right movement.
I chose transitions based on the brightness of the next scene that follows the previous one. For example and if next scene is darker  I'd use fade to black .
when I transition between music, I lower the volume of both music in the connecting scenes , and also make the volume gradually lower towards the end of the video.


4. Place this introduction into the description of your draft on YouTube or Vimeo. Double-check that the link is ready for sharing in class during the next session.
