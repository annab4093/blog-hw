## What is the website/app about:
an anonymous community where strangers who without sharing their personal identity/ features chat to each other and offer console.
## To match this theme,I made these overall design choices:
The reason I use mostly warm colour with moderate saturation and high brightness is because I intend to present a sense of relaxation and warmth.
I employed subtle gradient to create the sense that the icons are glowing under warm light to acheive a therapeutic effect by establishing a cozy mood.
I used round angles when outlining the icons as this allow icons to appear unintrusive and safe.

## Target audience : 
those who wants to better their mood and mental health in an interactive, engaging with people or volunteering psychologists in an cost free way, without exposing any personal identity information. 


## platform: 
website or mobile app, for they are easily accessible to all.



## The process of making the icons : 
Design the function of each Icon, hand drawn draft icons,digitalise by start from pen tool or shape to create outline according to  the icon designs that are already hand drawn, then determining its colour, adjusting the shapes size, angle or curve of lines, size of line,adjust colour, gradients.Finding music according to what sort of vibe or feeling each icon convey based on its function.

## EXPLANATION of 9 icons. what they are each about and why I decide to design them this way:

## 1settings:
function: allow users to adjust setting eg text size...icon sequence...
Design: I was inspired by how gear or screw are universally used to represent icon settings, so I used simple hexagon shapes to simulate these real life objects icon design,in lively bright green colour aesthetically more pleasing than grey. I rotated the shape to form a movement in gear or screw scene and although mechanical texture was not visually simulated I matched the flat icon with mechanical sound to compensate.

## 2homepage 
function: return to homepage
I used a sound of lamp being turned on coupled with icon showing door lighting up in orange to suggest user has returned to homepage. This intend to drawn an association to actual turning on light scene when returning to create a sense of familiarity when the viewer clicks it.

## 3my profile :
function: generate anonymous figure cartoon profile image ,no real identity will be accepted- this give a sense of privacy allowing people to share with other anonymous their struggles or happiness in life.Since every profile is anonymous it allows for Anonymous Posting:Allow users to post anonymously to encourage openness and honesty.

Both the icon design of faceless human figure shape with only head and body and no individuality and deep du sound intend to bringout a sense of mystery and anonymity.

## 4 chat:

Function : random matching two people online at the same time,   direct one on one message box
Peer-to-peer support through chat.

I illustrated a cute round chat bubble icon that will swap into a winking expression when clicked, the visual, matched with a cute bubble pop sound, intend to convey a sense of friendliness.

## 5 forums:
Function : group discussions (where users can revolve around a certain theme to share their experiences and advice.)
(its different from chat is that it allows multiple people to join a group discussion online or offline)

I used sound of various bubbles in a pool to imply that this is a platform where people can share a mixture diverse thoughts.
The blue heads intend to suggest this conversation platform will allow people to exchange conversation in calm and relaxed manner, and free of agression.

## 6 discovery planet
Function :  see therapeutic/ encouraging/mood bettering quotes/memes/pictures/videos)and see Educational Resources: such as  articles, videos on mental health topics.

I drew a planet icon as the word discovery may be visually represented by space exploration of unknown planets(symbolic of unknown content that may be beneficial and exciting to find out).
I used upbeat drum sound to bring out a sense of excitement making new discoveries hoping to spread the same emotion when viewer click to discover something unbeknown to them.

## 7 bookmark/favourite/saved 
Function : (to view saved/marked posts in forum /discovery)
As the bookmark is a symbol universally recognised to mark a page, I drew a bookmark sign so as to make the icon easily understandable to viewer.

## 8 Professional Support:
Function : post anything and be replied by psychologists volunteering to help
Access to mental health professionals for tailored guidance, support, and resources.

The change of icon from a stable figure that is symmetrical and in an overall triangular shape intend to give a sense of reliability. The swap of the icon  holding their hands up in the air symbolise enthusiasm and willingness to help,intending to present an sense that viewer is very welcomed. Both the gradient of the glow and sound intend to conveys the sense of enthusiasm and contentment to help out.


## 9 Mood Tracking:
Function : Mood calender tool for users to track their mood, energy levels.
I used lines within a heart shape to embody the fluctuation of mood swinging up and down.
I used a flipping page opwn sound to match the icon design of a calender which ,although doesnt show its actual texture, can be associated with a real life calender that is made out of paper.Initially I planned to have the calender white and did not planned to illustrate the detailed lines. But later thinking about how to prevent this icon from being interpreted as a  medical machine showing heart beat rather than a calender tool , I ended up adding the lines on and changing the colour to light warm yellow coloured. To further differentiate it from medical machine The pen tool icon appearing suggests it is allowing people to write and record their daily mood.
