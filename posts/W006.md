## Target audience : 
those who wants to better their mood and mental health in an interactive, engaging and cost free way, without exposing any personal identity information. 


## platform: 
website or mobile app, for they are easily accessible to all.


## What is the website/app about:
an anonymous community where strangers who without sharing their personal identity/ features chat to each other and offer console.
## To match this theme,I made these overall design choices:
The reason I use mostly warm colour with moderate saturation and high brightness is because I intend to present a sense of relaxation and warmth.
I employed subtle gradient to create the sense that the icons are glowing under warm light to acheive a therapeutic effect by establishing a cozy mood.
I used round angles when outlining the icons as this allow icons to appear unintrusive and safe.



## EXPLANATION of 9 icons. what they are each about and why I decide to design them this way:
![ ](w6/1.png)

## 1settings:
allow users to adjust setting eg text size...icon sequence...
icon design I twisted the angle of the shape to form a tightening screw scene and matched with mechanical sound.

## 2homepage ï¼ˆreturn to homepage
I used a sound of lamp being turned on coupled with icon showing door lighting up in orange to suggest user has returned to homepage. 

## 3my profile :
anonymous figure cartoon profile image ,no real identity will be accepted- sense of privacy allowing people to share with other anonymous their struggles or happiness in life.
every profile is anonymous. Anonymous Posting:Allow users to post anonymously to encourage openness and honesty.

Both the figure shape of icon design and deep sound intend to bringout a sense of mystery and anonymity.

## 4 chat:

random matching two people online at the same time,   direct one on one message box
Peer-to-peer support through chat.

I illustrated a cute round chat bubble icon matched with a cute bubble sound to convey a sense of friendliness.

## 5 forums:
 and group discussions (where users can revolve around a certain theme to share their experiences and advice.)
(its different from chat is that it allows multiple people to join a group discussion online or offline)

I used sound of various bubbles in a pool to imply that this is a platform where people can share a mixture diverse thoughts.
The blue heads intend to suggest this conversation platform will allow people to exchange conversation in calm and relaxed manner, and free of agression.

## 6 discovery planet
 ( see therapeutic/ encouraging/mood bettering quotes/memes/pictures/videos)and see Educational Resources: such as  articles, videos on mental health topics.

I drew a planet icon as the word discovery may be visually represented by space exploration of unknown planets(symbolic of unknown content that may be beneficial and exciting to find out).
I used drum sound to bring out a sense of excitement making new discoveries.

## 7 bookmark/favourite/saved 
(to view saved/marked posts in forum /discovery)
As the bookmark is a symbol universally recognised to mark a page, I drew a bookmark sign so as to make the icon easily understandable to viewer.

## 8 Professional Support:
post anything and be replied by psychologists volunteering to help
Access to mental health professionals for tailored guidance, support, and resources.
The change of icon from a stable figure to holding their hands up in the air symbolise enthusiasm and willingness to help. Sound also conveys the sense of enthusiasm and a sense of contentment.


## 9 Mood Tracking:
Mood calender tool for users to track their mood, energy levels
I used a flipping page icon to match the icon design of a calender allowing people to write and record their daily mood.
