Homework Tasks - Week 5, Session 1

translate your chosen thumbnail sketches into the Flat Design style, in Illustrator. 

3. Choose one of your icon designs, and use the tools in Illustrator to 
create a 
colour design for it 

using only one hue. You may vary this hue through value and saturation.

4. Create another colour design for the same icon, but this time bring in 
another hue, so there's two. 
Continue creating colour designs for the icon, each time bringing in an additional hue, until you feel there are too many. Repeat this process for at least four more icons: you should end up with at least
 16 total colour variations.

5. Upload all of these designs to your blog, and reflect on 

which colour schemes you think might work best for your concept, and 

why.
