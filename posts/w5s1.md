Homework Tasks - Week 5, Session 1

translate your chosen thumbnail sketches into the Flat Design style, in Illustrator. 

3. Choose one of your icon designs, create a colour design for it 
using only one hue. You may vary  value and saturation.

4. Create another colour design for the same icon, but this time bring in 
another hue.

Continue creating colour designs for the icon, each time bringing in an additional hue, until you feel there are too many. Repeat this process 

for at least four more icons:
 you should end up with at least
 16 total colour variations.

5. 

which colour schemes you think might work best for your concept, and why.
I think warm colours with relatively high brightness and moderate satuation work best, as this convey a sense of warmth and coziness which aligns with my app or website's intention of creating a comfortable and heartwarming community for people to talk openly about their feelings or experiences.
