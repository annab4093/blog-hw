##  formalise the written components of your folio webpage into a series of paragraphs that will frame your work and progress over the semester in a clear, accessible, and engaging manner. 


Brief overview of What my works are about: My work encompasses a series of non-narrative video, 3D environment design and graphic designs. They explore the depths of  my personal identity, emotional transitions, and the journey through a changing lifestyle. In the future, I would like to specialise in editing or graphic design. 

## Artist Statement for Assignment 1: Video Edit

 My work in this assignment is a introspective non-narrative video that delves into the self-discovery of personal interest, aspiration .

I created this video filmeing objects and space reflective of my personal identity whilst aiming to express the and emotional evolution from initial anxiety and eventual serenity. The work captures the feeling of being overwhelmed by time constraints and the aspiration to excel.The montage are connected based on visual continuity through movement direction, and similarity in shape. 

The video is crafted through the process of storyboard- filming and editing by combining visuals and sound, with pacing that shifts from rapid and urgent to slow and calming. I've employed a variety of footage and sound design to create a sense of movement and express personal interests.


## Artist Statement for Assignment 2: Graphic Icons

 This suite of therapeutic graphic icons is designed for an anonymous community platform, aiming to provide emotional support and mental health resources.

 With the goal to create icons that convey warmth, safety, and a sense of community. These icons are meant to be universally understood and emotionally resonant.

The icons were developed through a process of hand-drawn drafts, digital refinement, and careful consideration of color and form. Each icon is paired with a specific sound to enhance its emotional impact.



## Artist Statement for Assignment 3: Virtual Environment

 My work is an interactive virtual environment that metaphorically represents the transformation of lifestyle from an indoor to outdoors person, and the transition from a narrow path to a broader life perspective.

I create this environment to reflect on  the realization that life offers more than a single, straight path to a fulfilled life. It's a space for contemplation and the appreciation of diverse life experiences.

The environment was developed through a process of mapping, greybox prototyping, sourcing and building assets.  The environment is designed with a deliberate shift from confined indoor spaces to open, expansive outdoor space. The use of color-from desaturated to colorful,shapes-from restrictive closed space to liberating open space and matching audio are carefully curated to guide the user's through a journey experiencing different emotions.




##  Implement skills learnt in Figma. No layout or organisation for now.

 Tried adding a photo in shape by 3 methods: 1 file- place image 2 ctrl+ shift+ k + select shape 3 select shape - colour fill section (third icon to fill image):

creating  a rectangle shape- changing the corner radius - experiment with gradient effect:

## Visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer.

I plan to use simple shapes, colours reflective of my taste and clear readable fonts to express the content.
