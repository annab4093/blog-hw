## Implemented the content of the website according to wireframe:
![ ](a4/11.png)

## Process and experiment with design
I duplicated the second wireframe and gradually filled colours or images to every shape including background rectangle while experimenting with various effects.
Then I explored with different fonts to see which one I prefer.Initially, I wanted to use AB instead of XB the Initial letters of my Chinese Name, but the shape of letter A doesn't align with my use of rectangular shapes compared to X. So I decided to settle with X.

**Font and layout experiment:**

![](a4/Blur.png)
Experiment with Layer blur effect on a group of six overlapping ellipses blurred to various degree.
I removed the black background temporariily to see if the effect is better with black or white background and settled with black background.

changed gradient colours and added layer blur to the group


## web accessibility & contrast checker

**Accessibility in displaying and reading this text:**
The right hand corner of the intro page give instruction to audience to click to see details, making it clear to even those who are not tech savy. These texts are set in 16pts, with words 'shape' and 'out' set at 17pts while having brighter colour to stand out a little more.

All texts are presented with **visual hierarchy** with clear larger headings and minimal text to indicate what happens when audience clicks the shape. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I added **drop shadow effect** on the below white heading texts to create greater emphasis on the text by separating them with background.
Having used a **contrast checker plugin**,I realise that white text is  still not clear enough on this part of the background which is relatively higher in brightness. So I changed the text the brown.

## Added overlays:

I discovered that to show shapes with pictures inside, the larger shapes needed to have a frame underneathe to get images appear along side the shape.

**Contrast:**
The overlay texts are black and white with greatest contrast allowing readibility.The main body text are between 20pts to 26pts well above the 16pts standard.


## Grid-based layout.
I used 12 column grid and 4 column and align the shapes:

## Compare the current iteration of your webpage with the version that you originally envisioned:

I had changed the group of long vertical rectangles rounder corner rather than hard edges and added layer blur effect to the entire group so as to make them look more natural.

 I decided instead of presenting all the texts in the webpage, use simpler small shapes with open overlays to show detail explanation only when they click on these shapes with text. This aims to avoid having huge chunks of text that takes away the sense of simplicity.
